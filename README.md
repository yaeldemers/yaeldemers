## Hi, my name is Yael ðŸ¤™
### I design games and I code stuff

- In 2019, I co-founded [Shark and Sandals](https://sharkandsandals.com/), a start up designing and publishing tabletop games.

- I recently graduated from McGill University in MontrÃ©al (Tio'tia:ke) with a double major in Physics and Computer Science
  and a minor in Statistics. 

- I am currently working as a Financial Modeling Analyst at Direxyon Technologies here in MontrÃ©al. 
  
You can find most of my work here or on [my portfolio](https://yaeldemers.com/) (outdated).
