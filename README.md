## Hi, my name is Yael ðŸ¤™
### I design game and I code stuff

- In 2019, I co-founded [Shark and Sandals](https://sharkandsandals.com/), a start up designing and publishing board games.

- I am an undergraduate student / researcher from Tio'tia:ke (MontrÃ©al). 

- I am currently majoring in Physics and Computer Science and minoring in statistics.


As of 2021, I started learning web development and I am currently learning the MERN stack.  
Once I'm comfortable with it, I plan on learning Django and starting mobile development.

You can find most of my work here or on [my portfolio](https://yaeldemers.com/).
