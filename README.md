## Hi, my name is Yael ðŸ¤™
### I design game and I code stuff

- In 2019, I co-founded [Shark and Sandals](https://sharkandsandals.com/), a start up designing and publishing tabletop games.

- I am an undergraduate student at McGill University in MontrÃ©al (Tio'tia:ke). 
  I am puersuing a double major in Physics and Computer Science as well as a minor in Statistics. 

- I previously interned as a Software Developer Engineer @Amazon in Toronto, Canada.

As of 2022, I started diving deeper into video game development. 
This seems to be a great middle ground between my love for computer science and games design.

You can find most of my work here or on [my portfolio](https://yaeldemers.com/).  
If you wish to collaborate on any project, just shoot me an email at yaeldemers@gmail.com ðŸš€
